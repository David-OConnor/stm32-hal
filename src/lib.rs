//! This library provides high-level access to STM32 peripherals.
//!
//! **Current family support**: F3, F4, L4, L5, G0, G4, H7, and WB. U5 is planned once its SVD files and PAC
//! become available.
//!
//! Please see the [Readme](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/blob/main/README.md) for a detailed overview,
//! and the [examples folder on Github](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples)
//! for example code and project structure.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//! Review the [syntax overview example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/syntax_overview)
//! for example uses of many of this library's features. Copy and paste its whole folder (It's set up
//! using [Knurling's app template](https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template)), or copy parts of `Cargo.toml`
//! and `main.rs` as required.
//!
//! The [blinky example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/blinky) provides a detailed example and instructions for how to set up a blinking
//! light (ie hello world) using an STM32F411 "blackpill" board. Its readme provides instructions for how to get
//! started from scratch, and its code contains detailed comments explaining each part. The
//! [blinky with timer interrupt example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/blinky_timer_interrupt)
//! demonstrates how to accomplish the same in a non-blocking way, using a hardware timer. It uses RTIC.
//!
//! The [conductivity module example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/conductivity_module)
//! is a complete example of simple production firmware. It uses the DAC, I2C, Timer, and UART peripherals,
//! with a simple interupt-based control flow.
//!
//! The [PDM mic, DAC output passthrough example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/pdm_mic_dac_output.rs)
//! demonstrates how to read audio from a digital microphone, output it to headphones or speakers using the DAC, and use DMA
//! to do this efficiently. It conducts minimal processing, but can be modified to process using DSP between input and output.
//! This example uses RTIC.
//!
//! Additional examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples) demonstrate
//! how to use various STM32 peripherals; most of these examples focus on a single peripheral.
//!
//! When specifying this crate as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`, you need to specify a feature
//! representing your MCU. If this is for code that runs on an MCU directly (ie not a library), also
//!  include a run-time feature, following the template `l4rt`. For example:
//! ```toml
//! cortex-m = { version = "^0.7.7", features = ["critical-section-single-core"] }
//! cortex-m-rt = "0.7.2"
//! stm32-hal2 = { version = "^1.5.5", features = ["l4x3", "l4rt"]}
//! ```
//!
//! If you need `embedded-hal` traits, include the `embedded-hal` feature.
//!
//! You can review [this section of Cargo.toml](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/blob/main/Cargo.toml#L61)
//! to see which MCU and runtime features are available.
//!
//! ### Example highlights:
//! ```rust
//! use cortex_m;
//! use cortex_m_rt::entry;
//! use stm32_hal2::{
//!     clocks::Clocks,
//!     gpio::{Pin, Port, PinMode, OutputType},
//!     i2c::I2c,
//!     low_power,
//!     pac,
//!     timer::{Timer, TimerInterrupt},
//! };
//!
//! #[entry]
//! fn main() -> ! {
//!    let mut dp = pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();
//!
//!    let clock_cfg = Clocks::default();
//!    clock_cfg.setup().unwrap();
//!
//!    let mut pb15 = Pin::new(Port::A, 15, PinMode::Output);
//!    pb15.set_high();
//!
//!    let mut timer = Timer::new_tim3(dp.TIM3, 0.2, Default::default(), &clock_cfg);
//!    timer.enable_interrupt(TimerInterrupt::Update);
//!
//!    let mut scl = Pin::new(Port::B, 6, PinMode::Alt(4));
//!    scl.output_type(OutputType::OpenDrain);
//!
//!    let mut sda = Pin::new(Port::B, 7, PinMode::Alt(4));
//!    sda.output_type(OutputType::OpenDrain);
//!
//!    let mut dma = Dma::new(dp.DMA1);
//!    dma::mux(DmaPeriph::Dma1, DmaChannel::C1, DmaInput::I2c1Tx);
//!
//!    let i2c = I2c::new(dp.I2C1, Default::default(), &clock_cfg);
//!
//!    loop {
//!        i2c.write(0x50, &[1, 2, 3]);
//!        // Or:
//!        i2c.write_dma(0x50, &BUF, DmaChannel::C1, Default::default(), DmaPeriph::Dma1);
//!
//!        low_power::sleep_now();
//!    }
//!}
//! ```
//!
//! Supports the RTIC `Monotonic` trait. To enable, use the `monotonic` feature.
//!
//! [This article](https://www.anyleaf.org/blog/writing-embedded-firmware-using-rust) provides some information
//! on using this library, as well as background information on Rust embedded in general.
//!
//! ## Docs caveat
//! This Rust docs page is built for `STM32H735`, and some aspects are not accurate for other
//! variants. Clock (RCC) config in particular varies significantly between variants. We currently
//! don't have a good solution to this problem, and may self-host docs in the future.

// Some overall notes:
// We generally don't use the named field methods provided by PACs, as these are inconsistently
// implemented among PACs. Ie f3's may have a `'`.enabled()` method, but `l4` does not;
// in these cases, writing `set_bit()` works for both.

// We use a combination of macros and feature-gating to handle differences in families, as appropriate.
// We leverage the `paste` and `cfg-if` crates to improve syntax.

// The main way we divide MCUs is by PAC modules. Note that there are sub-variants that may have differences
// that this doesn't take into account. (eg different USB memory sizes among f303 variants)

// We use `unsafe` blocks for most multi-fit field writes. This is required by some PACs, but not others.
// The rust embedded team removes requirement for `unsafe` on fields that are deemed sufficiently
// constrained as to not need these blocks.
// Using `unsafe` for all is cleaner than feature-gating, due to how many fields this affects. We've allowed
// these warnings; ie hidden during build.

#![no_std]
// Some reg modifications are marked `unsafe` in some PAC crates, but not others.
// Disable these warnings.
#![allow(unused_unsafe)]
// The `doc_cfg` feature allows us to show functionality that is feature-gated on `docs.rs`.
// todo: Re-implement the doc_cfg feature and the relevant tags (From all modules that impl EH traits)
// todo oncoe this is in stable.
// #![feature(doc_cfg)]

// todo: H7B3 has too many changes in v14 PAC; not supporting at this time. (2021-10-07)

// Used for while loops, to allow returning an error instead of hanging.
