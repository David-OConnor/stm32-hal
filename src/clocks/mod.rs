//! This module contains clock configurations for various MCUs. They tend to be significantly
//! different from one another, so we've feature-gated these files, rather than
//! code within the files, to differentiate families.
//!
//! See STM32CubeIDE for an interactive editor that's very useful for seeing what
//! settings are available, and validating them.
//!
//! See the Reference Manuals for non-interactive visualizations.
