//! This module contains clock configurations for various MCUs. They tend to be significantly
//! different from one another, so we've feature-gated these files, rather than
//! code within the files, to differentiate families. This documentation is built for H723, and will
//! not be correct for other variants. For F series defaults, check out the [Default impl here](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/blob/main/src/clocks/f).
//! [Check here for other H7 variants](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/blob/main/src/clocks/h7.rs) For other
//! STM32 families, [look here](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/blob/main/src/clocks/baseline.rs).
//!
//! Alternatively, you can examine the `CLocks` structure to see which scalers are set, or generate docs locally
//! for your variant.//!
//!
//! See STM32CubeIDE for an interactive editor that's very useful for seeing what
//! settings are available, and validating them.
//!
//! See the Reference Manuals for non-interactive visualizations.
