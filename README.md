# STM32-HAL

[![Crate](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/stm32-hal2.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/stm32-hal2)
[![Docs](https://docs.rs/stm32-hal2/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/stm32-hal2)

This library provides high-level access to STM32 peripherals. 

## Requirements
1. Provide high-level access to most STM32 peripherals
2. Support these STM32 families: `F3`, `F4`, `L4`, `L5`, `G`, `H`, `U`, and `W`
3. Allow switching MCUs with minimal code change
4. Provide a consistent API across peripheral modules
5. Support both DMA and non-DMA interfaces
6. Be suitable for commercial projects
7. Implement [embedded-hal](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal) traits for all applicable peripherals
8. Provide a clear, concise API
9. Provide source code readable by anyone cross-checking a reference manual (RM)


## Specifications
- Base code on instructions described in reference manuals (RM); document inline with
the relevant excerpts [4, 9]
- Use [STM32 Peripheral Access Crates](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs) to allow high-level
register access [2]
- Wrap PAC register blocks in structs that represent the applicable peripheral, and access features
of these peripherals using public methods [1]
- Use `#[cfg]` blocks, and the `cfg_if!` macro to handle differences between MCUs; use separate modules
 where large differences exist [2, 3]
- Use both peripheral struct methods, and `embedded-hal` trait implementations for non-DMA interfaces; use additional
 struct methods for DMA interfaces [4, 5, 7]
- Favor functionality, ergonomics, and explicit interfaces [6, 8]
- Document configuration code with what registers and fields it sets, and desriptions from RMs [4, 9]
- Provide examples and documentation that demonstrate peripheral use with interrupts and DMA [6]


## Supported MCUs
F3, F4, L4, L5, G0, G4, H7, WB, and WL. U5 is planned once its SVD files and PAC
become available.

Operationally tested on the following devices:
- STM32F303
- STM32F411
- STM32L476, L433, L443, L412, L432
- STM32L552
- STM32WB5MMG
- STM32H743(V)


## Getting started

### Quickstart
- [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- Install the compilation target for your MCU. Eg run `rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf`. You'll need to change the last part if using a Cortex-M0, Cortex-M33, (Eg Stm32G0 or L5 respectively) or if you don't want to use hardware floats.
- Install flash and debug tools: `cargo install flip-link`, `cargo install probe-run`.
- Clone the [quickstart repo](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal-quickstart): `git clone https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal-quickstart`.
- Change the following lines to match your MCU. Post an issue if you need help with this:
  - `Cargo.toml`: `stm32-hal2 = { version = "^1.3.2", features = ["l4x3", "l4rt"]}`
  - `memory.x`: `FLASH` and `RAM` lines
  - `.cargo/config.toml`: `runner` and `target` lines.
- Connect your device. Run `cargo run --release` to compile and flash.


### Details
Review the [syntax overview example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/syntax_overview)
for example uses of many of this library's features. Copy and paste its whole folder (It's set up
using [Knurling's app template](https://github.com/knurling-rs/app-template)), or copy parts of `Cargo.toml` 
and `main.rs` as required.

The [blinky example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/blinky), written by
[toudi](https://github.com/toudi), provides a detailed example and instructions for how to set up a blinking
light (ie hello world) using an STM32F411 "blackpill" board. Its readme provides instructions for how to get
started from scratch, and its code contains detailed comments explaining each part.

The [conductivity module example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/conductivity_module)
is a complete example of simple production firmware. It uses the DAC, I2C, Timer, and UART peripherals,
with a simple interupt-based control flow.

The [PDM mic, DAC output passthrough example](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples/pdm_mic_dac_output.rs)
demonstrates how to read audio from a digital microphone, output it to headphones or speakers using the DAC, and use DMA
to do this efficiently. It conducts minimal processing, but can be modified to process using DSP between input and output.
This example uses RTIC.

Additional examples in the [examples folder](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/tree/main/examples) demonstrate
how to use various STM32 peripherals; most of these examples focus on a single peripheral.

When specifying this crate as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`, you need to specify a feature
representing your MCU. If this is for code that runs on an MCU directly (ie not a library), also
 include a run-time feature, following the template `l4rt`. For example: 
```toml
cortex-m = "0.7.3"
cortex-m-rt = "0.6.13"
stm32-hal2 = { version = "^1.3.2", features = ["l4x3", "l4rt"]}
```

If you need `embedded-hal` traits, include the `embedded-hal` feature.

You can review [this section of Cargo.toml](https://github.com/David-OConnor/stm32-hal/blob/main/Cargo.toml#L61)
to see which MCU and runtime features are available.

### Example highlights:
```rust
use cortex_m;
use cortex_m_rt::entry;
use stm32_hal2::{
    clocks::Clocks,
    gpio::{Pin, Port, PinMode, OutputType},
    i2c::I2c,
    low_power,
    pac,
    timer::{Timer, TimerInterrupt},
};

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    let mut dp = pac::Peripherals::take().unwrap();

    let clock_cfg = Clocks::default();
    clock_cfg.setup().unwrap();

    let mut pb15 = Pin::new(Port::A, 15, PinMode::Output);
    pb15.set_high();

    let mut timer = Timer::new_tim3(dp.TIM3, 0.2, &clock_cfg);
    timer.enable_interrupt(TimerInterrupt::Update);

    let mut scl = Pin::new(Port::B, 6, PinMode::Alt(4));
    scl.output_type(OutputType::OpenDrain);

    let mut sda = Pin::new(Port::B, 7, PinMode::Alt(4));
    sda.output_type(OutputType::OpenDrain);

    let i2c = I2c::new(dp.I2C1, Default::default(), &clock_cfg);

    loop {
        i2c.write(0x50, &[1, 2, 3]);
        low_power::sleep_now();
    }
}
```

## Compatible with RTIC
[Real-Time Interrupt-driven Concurrency](https://rtic.rs/0.5/book/en/) is
a light-weight framework that manages safely sharing state between contexts. Eg between ISRs and the main loop. 
Most examples use global `Mutex`es, `RefCell`s, and `Cell`s, sometimes
with macros to simplify syntax; you could easily substitute RTIC syntax.

## Why this module is different from `stm32yxx-hal` libraries
There are some areas where design philosophy is different. For example: GPIO 
type-checking, level-of-abstraction from registers/PAC, role of DMA, role of `embedded-hal` traits in the API, 
feature parity among STM32 families, code documentation, code structure, and clock config.

If you'd like to learn more about these HALs, check them out on the [stm32-rs Github](https://github.com/stm32-rs).
You may prefer them if you prioritize strict type checks on GPIO pins, for example.
   
## Docs caveat
The Rust docs page is built for `STM32L4x3`, and some aspects are not accurate for other
variants. We currently don't have a good solution to this problem, and may
self-host docs in the future.


## Contributing

PRs are encouraged. Documenting each step using reference manuals is encouraged where applicable.

Most peripheral modules use the following format:

- Enums for various config settings, that implement `#[repr(u8)]` for their associated register values
- A peripheral struct that has public fields for config. This struct also includes
a private `regs` field that is the appropriate reg block. Where possible, this is defined generically
in the implementation, eg:
`U: Deref<Target = pac::usart1::RegisterBlock>`. Reference the [stm32-rs-nightlies Github](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32-rs-nightlies)
to identify when we can take advantage of this.
- If config fields are complicated, we use a separate `PeriphConfig` struct owned by the peripheral struct.
This struct impls `Default`.
- A constructor named `new` that performs setup code
- `enable_interrupt` and `clear_interrupt` functions, which accept an enum of interrupt type.
- Add `embedded-hal` implementations as required, that call native methods. Note that
we design APIs based on STM32 capabilities, and apply EH traits as applicable. We only
expose these implementations if the `embedded-hal` feature is selected.
- When available, base setup and usage steps on instructions provided in Reference Manuals.
These steps are copy+pasted in comments before the code that performs each one.
- Don't use PAC convenience field settings; they're implemented inconsistently across PACs.
(eg don't use something like `en.enabled()`; use `en.set_bit()`.)
- If using a commonly-named configuration enum like `Mode`, prefix it with the peripheral type,
eg use `RadarMode` instead. This prevents namespace conflicts when importing the enums directly.

## STM32WB and WL radio
This library doesn't include any radio functionality for the STM32WB. If you'd like to use it
with bluetooth, use this HAL in conjuction with with [@eupn](https://github.com/eupn)'s [stm32wb55](https://github.com/eupn/stm32wb55)
bluetooth library.

STM32WL radio support is WIP, and will be provided through interaction withnewAM's 
[stm32wl-hal](https://github.com/newAM/stm32wl-hal) library.
